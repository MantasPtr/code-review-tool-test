The provided code has a few issues related to type conversion and error handling:

1. **Type Conversion Issue:**
   - Description: The `numbers` list is created by splitting the user input string, which results in a list of strings. These string elements are not converted to integers or floats before they are passed to the `calculate_average` function. This will cause a `TypeError` when attempting to perform arithmetic operations on strings.
   - Severity Level: High
   - Line Number and Content: 
     - Line 7: `numbers = user_input.split(",")`

2. **Division by Zero Error Handling:**
   - Description: The function `calculate_average` does not handle the case where the `numbers` list might be empty. If the user enters no numbers, this will lead to a division by zero error.
   - Severity Level: Medium
   - Line Number and Content:
     - Line 2: `return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)`

3. **Input Validation:**
   - Description: There is no validation to check if the user input contains valid numbers. If the input includes non-numeric values, the conversion to integers or floats will fail.
   - Severity Level: Medium
   - Line Number and Content:
     - Line 6: `user_input = input("Enter numbers separated by comma: ")`

To resolve these issues, you can modify the code as follows:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    if not numbers:  # Check if the list is empty
        return 0  # Return 0 or appropriate value for empty input
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

def main():
    user_input = input("Enter numbers separated by comma: ")
    try:
        numbers = [float(num) for num in user_input.split(",") if num.strip()]  # Convert to float and handle empty strings
        print(calculate_average(numbers))
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter valid numbers.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

These modifications handle type conversion, division by zero, and input validation, improving the robustness of the code.
