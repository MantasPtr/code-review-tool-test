1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability**
   - **Severity Level**: High
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```python
     f'<li>{todo["title"]}</li>' for todo in todos
     ```
   - **Description**: The application directly includes user input (`todo["title"]`) in the HTML response without proper sanitization or escaping. This can lead to XSS attacks where malicious scripts are executed in the browser of anyone viewing the todo list.

2. **Lack of Input Validation**
   - **Severity Level**: Medium
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```python
     title = request.form['title']
     ```
   - **Description**: The application does not perform any validation on the input received from the user. While the HTML form requires the input, server-side validation is also necessary to ensure data integrity and security.

3. **Use of Debug Mode in Production**
   - **Severity Level**: Medium
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```python
     app.run(debug=False)
     ```
   - **Description**: Although the debug mode is set to `False`, it's important to ensure that this setting is not accidentally changed to `True` in a production environment as it can expose sensitive information and allow execution of arbitrary code.

4. **Hardcoded HTML in Python Code**
   - **Severity Level**: Low
   - **Line Number and Content**: Multiple lines, e.g.,
     ```python
     index_html = f'''<!DOCTYPE html>...
     ```
   - **Description**: The HTML content is hardcoded within the Python functions. This practice makes the code harder to maintain and less readable. It's better to use templates for generating HTML content.

5. **Global Variable for State Management**
   - **Severity Level**: Low
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```python
     todos = []
     ```
   - **Description**: Using a global variable (`todos`) for managing application state is not recommended, especially in a multi-threaded environment like a web server. This can lead to race conditions and inconsistent states. It's better to use a database or other state management systems.

These issues should be addressed to improve the security, maintainability, and robustness of the application.
