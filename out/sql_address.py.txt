1. **SQL Injection Vulnerability**
   - **Severity Level**: High
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```python
     cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM address WHERE user_id = '{user_id}'")
     ```
   - **Description**: The code directly interpolates `user_id` into the SQL query, which can lead to SQL injection if `user_id` is not properly sanitized. An attacker could manipulate the `user_id` parameter to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

2. **Database Connection Not Closed in Case of Early Return**
   - **Severity Level**: Medium
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```python
     if record is None:
         return "No address found for user", 404
     ```
   - **Description**: The database connection (`db.close()`) is not closed if the function returns early because no record is found. This can lead to resource leakage and eventually exhaust the database connections.

3. **Hardcoded Database Credentials**
   - **Severity Level**: Medium
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```python
     db = pymysql.connect("localhost")
     ```
   - **Description**: The database connection uses hardcoded credentials (in this case, just the host). For better security and flexibility, it's recommended to use environment variables or configuration files to manage such sensitive information.

4. **Lack of Input Validation**
   - **Severity Level**: Medium
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```python
     user_id = request.values.get("user_id")
     ```
   - **Description**: There is no validation on the `user_id` input. Malformed or unexpected input could lead to errors or security vulnerabilities, such as the aforementioned SQL injection.

5. **Improper Error Handling**
   - **Severity Level**: Low
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     ```python
     if record is None:
         return "No address found for user", 404
     ```
   - **Description**: The function returns a plain text error message. For a web service, it would be more appropriate to return a structured response, such as JSON, which can be more easily handled by client applications.

To address these issues:
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Ensure the database connection is closed in all cases by using a context manager or finally block.
- Use environment variables for database credentials.
- Validate `user_id` before using it in the query.
- Standardize error responses to use a consistent format like JSON.
