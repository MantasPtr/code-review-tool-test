1. **Issue: Trailing Space in Result**
   - **Severity Level**: Low
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     - Line 6: `new_word += char + " "`
   - **Description**: The function adds an extra space at the end of the returned string. This might not be desired in most cases where formatted output is expected without trailing spaces.

2. **Issue: Inefficient String Concatenation**
   - **Severity Level**: Medium
   - **Line Number and Content**: 
     - Line 6: `new_word += char + " "`
   - **Description**: In Python, string concatenation using `+=` in a loop is inefficient, especially for large strings. Each concatenation creates a new string and copies old contents to it, which can lead to significant performance overhead.

**Recommendation**: To address these issues, you can use the `join()` method for more efficient string manipulation and to avoid the trailing space:

```python
def add_letter_spacing(word):
    return ' '.join(word)
```
