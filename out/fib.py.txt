1. **Issue Description**: The function `fib` uses a recursive approach to calculate the Fibonacci number, which is highly inefficient for larger values of `n` due to excessive recomputation of the same values.
   
   **Severity Level**: High

   **Line Number and Content**:
   ```python
   5: return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
   ```

2. **Issue Description**: The function lacks input validation to ensure that `n` is a non-negative integer. Passing a negative integer or a non-integer value could lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors.

   **Severity Level**: Medium

   **Line Number and Content**:
   ```python
   1: def fib(n):
   ```
